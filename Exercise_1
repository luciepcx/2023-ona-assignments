The idea in this exercise is to deep dive into my LinkedIn contacts and understand the network behinf it creating nodes and edges. I made an attempt to plot it. 


df<-read_csv('C:/Users/33652/Documents/Canada/Mcgill/COURS/Winter semester/Orgaziational Network/Connections.csv')
attach(df)


### Count by employer and total count

library(dplyr)
counts_by_employer <- df %>% 
  group_by(if_else(is.na(Company), "No employer", Company)) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

total_count <- nrow(df)

print(counts_by_employer)
print(paste0("Total count: ", total_count))



### Edges and Nodes

install.packages('tidygraph')
library(tidygraph)

#Taking everyone except the one with no company
connections <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Company)) %>%
  mutate(name = paste0(`First Name`, " ", substr(`Last Name`, 1, 1)),
         Company = Company) %>%
  mutate(from=name,
         to=Company) %>%
  select(from, to)

graph_connections <- as_tbl_graph(connections)
graph_connections  


library(stringr)

graph_connections <- graph_connections %>%
  activate(nodes)


### Plotting the network
installed.packages('ggraph')
library(ggraph)

graph_connections %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_edge_diagonal() 


graph_connections %>%
  ggraph(layout = "kk") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name, color = name), size = 3) +
  geom_edge_diagonal(color = "gray", alpha = 0.4)
